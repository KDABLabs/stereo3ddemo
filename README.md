# Stereo Demonstrator

The Stereo Demonstrator provides demo applications to experiment with
stereo rendering on stereo capable displays from [Schneider Digital](https://www.schneider-digital.com/en/)

![alt text](https://github.com/KDABLabs/stereo3ddemo/blob/master/screenshot.png)

This project builds a Qt3D based application and (optionally) a Vulkan based application.

Both applications allow loading 3D files *(.obj, .fbx, .gltf ...)* to view them in stereo.
A 3D cursor is drawn at the intersection between the mouse and the 3D model (fallsback to being place on focus plane if no intersection)

***Note:** that the Vulkan based application relies on KDAB's Vulkan engine which is not open sourced at this time.*

## Features

### Stereo Camera Controls:
- Projection Type (Asymmetric Frustums, Toe In)
- Focus Distance
- Eye Separation
- Flip Eyes

### Focus Controls
- AutoFocus + Focus Area
- Manual Focus Distance

### Field of View Controls:
- Manually Specified
- Deduced from Physical Dimensions

### Cursor Controls:
- Appearance
- Color
- Size

### Misc Controls:
- Wireframe mode
- Frustum Viewer

## Requirements
- OpenGL support (compatible GPU and drivers installed)
- GPU that supports quad buffers / multilayered swapchains (Nvidia Quadro & RTX, AMD Pro & FirePro)
  - **Note:** content will be displayed side by side on GPUs that do not support that feature
- Qt 6.8 with the Qt3D optional module

## Building

### Using VSCode (recommended)
- Copy CMakePresets.json.example to CMakePresets.json
- Edit CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable in CMakePresets.json to point to the Qt install path
- Build with VSCode
- Launch KDAB_Qt_Qt3D_OpenGL

### Using Command Line
- mkdir build; cd build
- cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
- cmake --build .
- cmake --build . -t package
- ./KDAB_Qt_Qt3D_OpenGL
