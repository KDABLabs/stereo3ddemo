3DxWare SDK 4 for Microsoft Windows


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
The 3DxWare SDK provides a single interface to the 3DxWare driver 3D navigation
software.

In addition to this SDK, a current installation of 3Dconnexion 3DxWare version
10.8.12 or newer is required.
Visit http://www.3Dconnexion.com/ to download the latest 3DxWare release.


2. IMPORTANT NOTES
------------------
Only release (non-debug) libraries and assemblies are included.


3. SAMPLE DESKTOP PROGRAMS
--------------------------
(For web applications, see the "3DconnexionJS" section below.)

Sample desktop programs are provided with source code and Microsoft
Visual Studio solutions. They can be rebuilt with these solutions or CMake (see
notes below).

Microsoft Visual Studio version 2019 or newer is required. The "Community"
edition can also be used.

If you are using CMake, CMake version 3.11 or newer is required. 

C/C++ applications must link with a static library called "TDxNavLib.lib". It
provides stubs for the driver routines that live in the DLL. 

C# applications must reference the "TDx.SpaceMouse.Navigation3D.dll" assembly.
The assembly is installed by the driver in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).


3.1 BUILD NOTES
---------------
Set the sytem environment variable TDxWare_SDK_DIR to the location of the 
3DxWare SDK. This is required for the samples and CMake to find the 
<3DxWare SDK> and the shared projects.

Each sample can be rebuilt by opening the corresponding Visual Studios solution
in the main subdirectory for each demo. A CMake project file is also available
in the main subdirectory for the C++ samples.

When building a C++ application, the 3DxWare libraries must be linked in.
In Visual Studio, this is done by selecting Project->Properties->
Linker->Input and General.  Add the libraries to Input and the paths to
General. 

The library paths are:
<3DxWare SDK>\lib\<platform>\TDxNavLib.lib

You will also need to add the <3DxWare SDK>\inc path to the application's
settings to pick up the header (.h) files.

<3DxWare SDK>\samples\3DxTestNL
This is a C# sample and references the 3DxWare assembly 
<3DxWare SDK>\lib\bin\TDx.SpaceMouse.Navigation3D.dll

<3DxWare SDK>\samples\3DxTraceNL
This is a C++ sample that does not depend on any external reference.

Also refer to the "readme" files and other documentation in each sample directory.


3.2 WAMP INTERFACE
------------------
The C++ samples can also be built to communicate via websockets with the 
NLProxy server using the same interface that is available to web applications.
When using the websocket interface TDxNavLib.lib is no longer required. 
To enable the wamp interface define WAMP_CLIENT=1 in the compilation options.
The samples then have dependencies on OpenSSL, Boost, and NLohmann Json.

For CMake builds change the build option 'USE_NLPROXY_CLIENT' to ON in the
sample projects to enable the wamp interface build.


4. 3DCONNEXIONJS FRAMEWORK FOR WEB APPLICATIONS
----------------------------------------------
Also included in this SDK is the documentation and samples (web applications) 
for the "3DconnexionJS", a JavaScript framework to develop web applications
using the "Navigation Library".

For additional details, refer to the "readme_web.txt" text file and the PDF
documentation in "web" sub-directory.
